This is my implementation of the C library function malloc, calloc, realloc, and free

I have built in a data structure to store metadata for memory management on the heap in the form of a linked list.

This library is my favorite program that I wrote because it allowed me to see that the library calls I was making on C were just ordinary functions that I could also implement with enough low level knowledge.
